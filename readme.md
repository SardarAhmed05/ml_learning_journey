# ML Learning Journey

A personal learning repository documenting my journey in **Machine Learning** and **Data Science**, including core concepts, hands-on practice, and experiments using Python and popular libraries.

## 📚 Overview

This repository is intended for learning and practicing Machine Learning. It contains:

* Tutorials and notes on ML concepts
* Hands-on Python notebooks with experiments
* Datasets and small projects for practice
* Explorations in Data Science techniques

This repo is **private** for now, as it is a work in progress.
